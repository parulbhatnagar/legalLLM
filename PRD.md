## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### 🧩 Components:

1. **Document Ingestion Layer**

   * OCR (Tesseract), PDF Parser (Apache Tika), Metadata Extractor

2. **Text Processing & Chunking**

   * Break into logical sections (issue, judgment, etc.)

3. **Embedding & Vector Indexing**

   * Embedding Model: OpenAI `text-embedding-3`, BGE, or Instructor
   * Vector DB: Weaviate, Pinecone, FAISS, or Qdrant

4. **RAG Query Pipeline**

   * LangChain or LlamaIndex to manage retrieval and LLM prompt orchestration

5. **LLM Layer**

   * GPT-4 / Claude 3 / Mistral for output generation

6. **UI Layer**

   * Web UI for input, review, feedback, and exporting
   * REST APIs for integration with case management systems

## 📄 Sample Prompt Design (LLM)

```text
You are a legal analyst.

## New Case Summary:
{{summary_of_new_case}}

## Goal:
1. Summarize key insights from past similar cases.
2. Propose a strategy relevant to this case.
3. Cite and explain relevant precedents.

## Retrieved Past Cases:
{{retrieved_context}}

Respond with: [1] Summary, [2] Strategy, [3] Precedents
```

---

## 🔁 User Flow

1. **Upload New Case** → Extract facts + metadata
2. **RAG Retrieval** → Fetch semantically similar case chunks
3. **LLM Call** → Generate structured response
4. **Human Review** → Edit/approve strategy + references
5. **Save/Export** → Store or export AI suggestions
